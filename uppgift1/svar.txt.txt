What happens if the designers of the Storage class decide to change the implementation of the List to LinkedList?

The original main stops working, You need to change Persons in main to LinkedList or better change to List so it can handle LinkedList and ArrayList.



Think about the method calls in main - does trimToSize() exist in LinkedList?

LinkedList does not have a trimToSize method(since it does not need it).


Should Main know about what concrete type of List Storage provides?

No, maybe? Since it only prints out the names it does not need to know.
